The new scheme of Path Integral Molecular Dynamics is developed and validated:
S.Y. Willow, "Path Integral Molecular Dynamics at Zero Thermal Temperature," Chem. Phys. Lett. 674, 33-37 (2017).

The key physical concept in w-pimd scheme is that the distributions of quantum particles does not depend on the thermal temperature with the same idea of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in which the electron distributions are obtained in the fixed nuclei and show no dependence of the thermal temperature.
Hence, the imaginary temperature for the distributions of the quanatum particles is introduced as an independent variable. The value of the imaginary temperature is determined from the virial theorem of the harmonic oscillator in the statistical mechanics.
