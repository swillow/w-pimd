# w-pimd
The new scheme of Path Integral Molecular Dynamics was developed and validated:
S.Y. Willow, "Path Integral Molecular Dynamics at Zero Thermal Temperature," Chem. Phys. Lett. 674, 33-37 (2017).

The key physical concept of the w-pimd scheme is the same as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, in which the distribution of electrons or quantum particles is obtained in the fixed nuclei and is independent of thermal temperature.
Therefore, the imaginary temperature for the quantum particle distribution is introduced as an independent variable. The value of imaginary temperature is determined from the virial theorem of the harmonic oscillator in statistical mechanics.
